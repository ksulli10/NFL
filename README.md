# Set-up
If this is a first time set-up, run the script titled "Master Project Setup.R" to generate pbp data frames from nflscrapR (courtesy of Ron Yurko and Maksim Horowitz) including series success data (courtesy of Lee Sharpe.)  The script will create local .rds files to expedite future data import.

Any subsequent sessions can simply run "Local Load Setup.R" after opening the project.
